# StopFoodDecay
A mod for Outward that stops perishable food items from rotting.  Uses either Partiality or BepInEx.

## Partiality
The Partiality version of the mod requires:

Requires [Partiality 0.3.11](https://github.com/PartialityModding/PartialityLauncher/releases/tag/0.3.11 "Release Partiality 0.3.11") or [BepInEx Legacy (The BepInEx upload from Extended Quickslots)](https://www.nexusmods.com/outward/mods/41?tab=files "Extended Quickslots upload of BepInEx") with the [Partiality Wrapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/outward/mods/51 "Partiality Mod Wrapper for BepInEx")

NOTE: I have not tried the wrapper with BepInEx 5.0 RC1 Legacy to see if it works.

## BepInEx
The BepInEx version of the mod requires:

[BepInEx 5.0 RC1 (NOT the Legacy download)](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.0-RC1 "Release BepInEx 5.0 RC1")
